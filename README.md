`DRAMKA` is a president simulator card game.
The actions take place at the present time. As the president of a fictional country, you have to react to the events that will appear before your state. Each decision affects the outcome of further events in different ways. Your goal is to rule the country for as many years as possible. Once your reign is over, you continue to rule; however, as the new president.
